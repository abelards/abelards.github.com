  <article class="post-content koan">
    <p>Long ago, a novice was bragging he was the best coder among his brothers. <br />
<a href="http://thecodelesscode.com/names/Jinyu">Jinyu</a> heard of this, came to him, and said: “Your code is no good.”</p>

<p>“I code fast and well, my parts don’t break in production!”
was the outraged novice’s reply. <br />
“Still no good,” said Jinyu.</p>

<p class="c">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p>The novice became monk. He was caught bragging again. <br />
Jinyu came and said: “Your code is no good.”</p>

<p>“During the reviews, my code is well accepted by others!” he said angrily. <br />
“Still no good,” said Jinyu.</p>

<p class="c">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p>The monk was given new projects. He was glad his skills were at least recognised. <br />
Jinyu came and said: “Your code is no good.”</p>

<p>“The defects in each of my projects declined sharply, and the velocity went up!” he said proudly. <br />
“Still no good,” said Jinyu.</p>

<p class="c">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p>The monk became senior. He was given architectural tasks. <br />
Jinyu came and said: “Your code is no good.”</p>

<p>“My code is elegant, easy to maintain and evolve!” he said defensively. <br />
“Still no good,” said Jinyu.</p>

<p class="c">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p>Years passed. The senior monk was not bragging anymore. <br />
He came to Jinyu. “After all these years,” he said bowing, “my code is no good.”</p>

<p>“But with each passing year you’re tackling harder problems with fewer effort!” said Jinyu. <br />
“Still no good,” said the monk.</p>

<p>On that very instant, Jinyu asked him to become a master.</p>

<h3>Qi's Poem</h3>

<p>It’s good to be satisfied <br />
But look behind you <br />
Would you have gotten this far?</p>
