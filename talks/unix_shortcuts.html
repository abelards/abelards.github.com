Hi, welcome to this talk about Unix shortcuts!
I discovered recently that two skilled devs I admire didn't know these little life-savers.
In OS and my web IDE, I use a third of these daily.
On a terminal-heavy day, two thirds.
They quickly go into muscle memory: productivity and RSI will thank you!

# Alphabet
`ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQERSTUVWXYZ`

???
So I propose we practice our alphabet: 26 simple letters for 26 simple shortcuts.

---
# Alphabet
- `SQ`
- `CZ`
- `RGP`
- `AEBF`
- `DLT`
- `KUWH Y`
- `IJMV`
- `XNO`

???
Of course I need a more convenient order, right?

---
# Surprise!
- `^S` XOFF - stops output on screen
- `^Q` XON - turns back on

???
I mention these first because they can block your terminal.
This is how some people think their computer stalled and lose a sessions' worth of work.

---
# Processes
- `^C` kill process
- `^Z` background
- `fg` foreground (+number)

???
One of the first things you need to know:
kill/cancel if something goes wrong,
and pause/reopen your work.

---
# Search
- `^R` history
- `^G` cancel
- `^P` paste history lines

???
You liked what you did before? Want to do it again?
Typed something you want to improve?
Messed up something and want to clean that up?

---
# Moving
- `^A` beginning of line
- `^E` end of line

- `^B` backwards one char
- `^F` forwards one char

???
These also work on Unix and MacOSX text fields.
They are approved by the Church of Emacs.

---
# Inputs
- `^D` EOF - end of input: stops or quits
- `^L` clear screen
- `^T` invert characters

???
^D is nice when you want to quit and forgot if it's `exit`, `quit` or whatever.

---
# Deleting
- `^K` kill after cursor
- `^U` kill before cursor

- `^W` kill word before cursor
- `^H` kill character before cursor

- `^ `+`^W` set mark - kill region

- `^Y` yank the kill-ring

???
Church of Emacs approved, except ^U

---
# Copy/Paste
- `Ctrl+insert` - copy
- `Shift+insert` - paste

???
BTW last time I checked this is ultra-standard and even works on Windows.

---
# Special characters
- `^I` tab
- `^J` newline
- `^M` newline?
- `^V` verbatim - next char is literal

???
I'm not sure about ^J and ^M nuances.

---
# I'm missing three letters!
- `^N` & `^O` shift iN, shift Out
- `^X` I have no idea - try `^X^X`

???
Seriously, teletype?
Oh and ^X is probably extended commands, emacs-style, or...
hey, I noticed this allows me to have two cursors in a line and go back and forth.
`pushd`, `popd`, `cd -` style

---
# Depending on
- `sh`
- `$EDITOR`

???
Of course, tab-completion and shortcuts depend on your shell and editor.
Oh my ZSH!

---
# Alphabet
- `SQ` - lock/unlock
- `CZ`, `fg` - Processes
- `RGP` - search
- `AEBF` - moving
- `DLT` - inputs
- `KUWH Y` - deleting
- `IJMV` - special characters
- `XNO` - super-special characters
- now learn your punctuation `!!` `$?`

???
Unix terms are full of error codes, redo-commands, calling args back...
You should definitely learn your Unix punctuation!
