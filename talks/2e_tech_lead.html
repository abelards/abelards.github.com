Hi everyone,
I often get asked if I can be or refer to a CTO.
Coders also ask me how to become one, which would be another talk entirely (but this could do as an introduction).

# What is a CTO?

- Chinese Master?
- Young Gullible With Shiny Title?

???
As always, we first need to define what the topic at hand is.
Either you need an old guru, chinese-master like, and I bow to you,
or you need a single, young, gullible developer and the CTO title is a way to pay that guy[1] less.

[1] yes, I try to use inclusive language, but this actually is more targeted on guys than gals.
Women exploitation in the workplace is real, but this is also another
talk entirely and I'm not qualified to talk about it.

# What is a 2€ CTO?
## Some questions or advice <br /> I often repeat.

You will become a great CEO on slides 13, 20, 25, 36 and 40.

???
So, what these people need is a 2€ CTO.
Something you could use to quickly get, understand or emulate what a CTO does.
And preferably a thing that doesn't cost a thing.

Time is definitely NOT free, but peope think it is.
So... follow me, spend a little time, and you can be a decent CTO yourself :)

# Technology Adoption Lifecycle
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/45/DiffusionOfInnovation.png" />
### Works for products & hires

???
Here is the Technology Adoption Lifecycle.
If you sell a product, you will talk to these kind of people, one after another.

Interestingly enough, this will also work for your hires:
your cofounders are likely innovators (novelty attracts them),
your 1st hires are likely early adopters (novelty doesn't frighten them).

So be prepared: you will hire early/late majority:
either by opportunity (innovators are few) or attrition (innovators flee).

# Hype Cycle
<div style="background: #CCC;padding:1em;">
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Gartner_Hype_Cycle.svg" />
</div>

???
Here is the Hype Cycle.
A combination of many psychological and economic things, I won't dwell on that too much.

Just remember this applies to technologies. How do articles sound now?
Rails is Dead! NodeJS is all the rage!
(of course, you might just have a useless toy without a plateau of productivity)

Remember this also happens to people, and most likely to your company:
You barely even launched, you got media coverage? Great, remember it's inflated.
You have a product that works, invested in scaling, and nobody buys? Disillusionment.

Keep in mind that might drive your innovators away. How will you live through this?

History repeats itself, so you read Power Porn and imitate.

Hey, I hate to break this news to you, but there's only one Google or one Facebook.
BUT... There was a Yahoo, a Microsoft, an Apple, a Minecraft and a SnapChat!

People who succeeded will tell you their story, and attribute their luck to their work.
Their opportunity has already been grabbed.
Move on, good news is: there will be others.
If you make them happen.

# Programmer Competency Matrix

http://sijinjoseph.com/programmer-competency-matrix/

???
BTW, what is a good programmer?
A good dev will know technical interviews are hard to gauge a person,
and our human biases make it difficult to be fair and not swayed by subjective cues.
An alternative is working together. That can be long and expensive and you night not want that.

I suggest this matrix for SOME of the ratings/tests you give, but you can change/update it.
A few companies doing open-salary policies (FogCreek, Buffer) provide some matrices of their own.

But if you're ready to hire without a senior checking or without a dev at all,
it might be a nice exercise to give this to your candidate for self-assessment of skill.
Few people know this, and it will at least prove him you're serious about development / personal growth.

# History shapes code
## <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000059.html">Code/UI reflects history</a>

- That big customer's requirements
- Devices and leaky abstractions
- Support

???
We all lack time.
So whenever there's a quick win, quick fix, an emergency...
things get added without conscious, thought-out plan.

You will find your ocdebase (and your UI!) littered with these
choices from a big customer's needs, support requests,
and perhaps the legacy of the systems / integrations you supported,
in order.

# Org shapes code
## The code reflects the organisation

- This team and split responsibility
- That deadline-induced rush
- Who talks to whom
- Each intern
- Reorg

???
It is said code reflects the organisation that made it happen.

If you split responsibilities, it will show.
If you had a rush and never pay the technical debt, it shows.
By code styles, a seasoned dev can often feel which part was made by which interns.

If you change the organisation, you probably expect delays,
uncertainty, overlap and holes in many jobs. In code too.

class: center
# Org shapes code
## So what 'smells' are we looking for?

- Can do / Can't do
- Not my problem
- We don't know anymore

???
Like code, organisations have "smells":
- things which are not independently 100% wrong,
  but should tip you there's a thing to watch,

- things which are not wrong from time to time,
  but raise big warnings if you have several at once, or one for a long time.

In short, we all hate ass-covering, name-calling and flattery, but we all fall for them.
Fix this.

???
What we need is explained in The Pragmatic / Passionate Programmer.
Just read this, I don't have time to redo the stories and it's a shame to cut them.

**Monkey trap:** when you won't let go and you should
**Boiling frog:** when you want sudden changes and you should do it slowly
**Stone soup:** how to get buy-ins from a hostile crowd

# Interlude

Here's an interlude. You deserve it. It's a hard topic.
You are probably thinking of examples in your current / past jobs.
We're dealing with sad stuff right now, so let's admire this happiest man.

# Your stack
## What do you know <br />& how do you know it?
- Identity! Factoids!
- Trends! FOMO! FUD!
- A Full Rewrite in X is a Full Rewrite

???
For any technical choice, I will of course recommend either my company or Ruby/Rails.
With the years I've become more forgiving (some say less arrogant?),
and understand you probably chose your stack based on shiny blogs,
advice from people with vested interests, and rationalising choices.

I will talk about trends, SocialFX dealt with factoids.
Looking at trends is a nice indicator, but beware
- Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO -- what if I skipped the killer tech?)
- FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt -- these people win money if everyone believes their lies)

One of the biggest and probably unwitting examples is devs patting
themselves on the back when they've done a rewrite in another tech.
OK, they should, because they made their boss part with a big chunk of money
for them to play with new techs: being grateful is the least they can do :)

But the trick is: they already know the project and problems well,
and given a rewrite cost they probably have buy-in from the bosses.
But could they have got the same pleasure and gains just with time off
for a rewrite, from techn X to... tech X? It is often so.

# Your codebase
## Feedback from a guru
- Smells are right
- Understanding of skill is right
- anyway, he will answer "it depends"

???
Based on all this, if you happen to have a guru at hand,
their feelings about the code smells are probably right
(your code lacks clarity or consistency, syntax is weird...)
and their understanding of devs' skills are probably right.

But they don't have the history, and will probably say "it depends".
And if they don't, well, they're not a worthy guru ;)

---
class: center
# Your code
## "We need to rewrite everything" <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">is probably wrong</a>
- Why is this person telling you this?
- You got it wrong once, why not twice?
- You got it right once, why not expand?

???

We all pretend to be smartasses because we know what's right and
everything is obvious both in context and in hindsight.

Just remember the person might have a hidden interest:
money is obvious, trying to have the office closest to the window / coffee isn't.

If you're a late majority I probably should tell you risks are worth it,
and you sometimes need to change.
But this is a Ruby meetup, so instead I probably have to tell you to slow down
and weigh options. If not for the project, at least to get some respect.

Nothing is all black or all white, you can probably please both sides
of the table by just isolating what is or isn't worth it. And you'll
know both your codebase and the problem space better.

class: center
# Your goals
## Are you choosing
- <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000024.html">McD vs gourmet food?</a>
- Someone just like you?
- To be a boss or leader?
- Lang skills or problem-solving?
- To solve scalability that won't happen?

???
So if we're turning the "choosing the right tech" into a
"choosing the right person (with some tech knowledge)" debate,
we should probably inquire about how we choose people.

And how we choose problems too.

---
class: center
# Your TODO
## Are you choosing people to

- make it
- test it
- change it
- deploy it
- run it
- fix it

???
Here's the sanity check: would you trust someone to make but not test?
To run but not fix? If not, that is a huge no-go.

I actually don't think there are so many people with such a problem.
But I do think some have problems with these, and you can help with the right environment.

# Your speed
## <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000017.html">(it takes 10 years)</a>
- Few people = consistent design
- More people = more layers/waste
- Recurring annoyances:
- noticed and fixed quickly?
- SMART goals

???
How's your speed in this?
Actually I don't know, but Joel says it'll take ten years.

If it's going to take 10 years' worth of lessons,
you might as well make sure to get them fast.

I'm not saying FAIL fast, because even this became void of meaning.
I don't want you to fail, I want you to experiment fearlessly, with control and metrics.
Risk-averse people might be great to suggest risk mitigation conducts.

One I have to address quickly is: the solution is not so often to add more people.

Notice this is "choosing the right problem" not for your devs, but for you.

# Interlude

Complex topic ahead, so I figured we'd need a slight pause to renew attention.

# Identity
## Defining oneself by X is the most powerful thing

- Age thing
- Opportunity to become a leader
- To be with the cool guys
- Easier to find jobs
- ... or is it?

???
Defining oneself as X is the most powerful thing.
Your parents, culture, teenage rebellion, whatever makes most impression
on your life and whatever helps you in dire times are probably "I am a X".
Is a programming language worth this?
I may be passionnate, but I don't think so.

Choosing a favourite language often happens just as you switch jobs.
More often, as you enter your first job, since you're not likely to change.
So it's an age thing.

You probably found an identity to get a cool job with cool guys, why not.

---
class: center
# Identity
## Defining oneself by a network

- Support
- Learning
- Local Guru

???
We also have some more reasons which lead most of us (who last in coding jobs)
to look for support and mentoring, if only for a feeling of community.
We ARE social animals indeed.

---
class: center
# Identity
## Defining oneself by X is the most *dangerous* thing

- Trolls
- Traitors
- Stuck there
- Echo chamber
- Useless rivalries

???
But this leads to dangerous pitfalls.
How will you handle attacks on your identity? On your bread-winning skills?
How will you accept when someone switches to another lang? Traitor? Idiot?

What if you invest so much you can't leave? (THAT is a Monkey Trap, by the way)

What if you alienate super nice people just because they didn't have
the exact same epiphany at the exact same point?

# Identity
## Your company

- <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/10.html">Identity Method of Management</a>
- It's given and taken, not taught
- Identity is a shared goal
- Perhaps devs have lessons for you


<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000007.html">Not Invented Here Syndrome</a>

???
And since we all fall for it, we might as well use it to our own advantage.

When managing by "Command and Control" or using money don't work on
the spoiled brats we are, it's the only solution you have anyway.

(Just kidding: there's more to "Econ 101" than just money.
Find this, give it to us, and you're King of the Devs.)

# Interlude

---

# Team
## It's all they talk about

- VC invest in it?
- More than a spouse?
- Take time to get better
- Echo chamber or diversity

???
Yes I'm repeating things, but it's good to look back on common wisdom.

---
class: center, ruby
# Team
## It's too hard to hire seniors

- Understand what they need
- Mentors, someone to look up to
- Non-dev tech people (<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2010/01/26.html">testers?</a>)
- Designers, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000057.html">UX people</a>
- Other non-tech (politics *shielders*)
- Train juniors

???
Here are super ideas if you can't hire seniors devs:
- hire people who aren't devs
- give non-seniors the ability to deliver like seniors

And it's easier than you think. You just have to shed some prejudices.

---
class: center, ruby
# Team
## What they need

- Politics-free
- Offices, quiet
- Books, tools

???
Free the devs from politics, from noise and interruptions,
give them tools and (the right amount of) freedom.

This costs WAY LESS than hiring more people, by the way.

---
class: center, ruby
# Team
## Multitasking or not?

- Fun challenge?
- Foolish hiding?
- A success a day!

???
Sociologists know the "audience effect".
For simple tasks, check on me so I don't get bored or wander on the Internet.

And try to make it sound like a challenge, that'd help (though I won't be fooled long).

But for complex tasks, leave me alone: I have to check/test things I might be
embarrassed about, or I fear you wouldn't understand and don't want to lose
time explaining.

My brain is working at top speed, and any hindrance will slow your
problem from getting a solution. Your call, now.

class: center, ruby
# Individuals
## 10x developer

- 10x the bullshit
- 10x manager?

???
Top speed?

The fact that there can be 10x developers is probably an ego-flattering scam.
Even if it works, it probably means there is poor person/task fit.

This is not fixed by hiring 10x devs (would you pay the 10x salary they deserve?)
but in recruiting and managing people.

Also, if there is a tiny truth behind 10x devs, it's so harmful to people
(beginners and introverts particularly) that it's not worth seeking anyway.

You might hire a costly rockstar by promising a 10x-devs-team.
You would have an even better ROI by having a compassionate tech lead
who would raise the bar and triple the productivity for each of your 5 juniors.

---
class: center, ruby
# Individuals
## So who should I hire?

# Dreyfus Team
## Experts write tools for others to use
- Dreyfus' model of skill
- acquisition (bonus slide #1)
- Enhances productivity
- Reduces damage
- Get to Flow

???
If I've shown you something it's how you can't and shouldn't have an
all-experts team, be it for long-term purposes, accident-proofing your
team, or simply to maximise revenue.

In a mixed-skill environment, or to onboard people safely,
you probably want to have some code, or code-writing process,
which also is Baka-Yoke ("stupid-proof").

This will let beginners learn recipes to become proficient,
let skilled room to experiment and confront their model,
and harness the maximum out of the masters.

## Know where to go
### But docs are boring / for suits

???
Sorry, this one didn't fit so... stuck at the end for openings!

Your devs need to know where to go, and nobody wants to write docs.
Also, the level is often wrong: too many details or not enough.

I suggest you learn this skill, by writing the doc yourself
(your devs will love you for that) and asking them honest feedback
(so you're not the PPT-boss).

Accept all criticism from them, but they will have to accept the occasional
"if you don't like it, write it yourself" (to be shown, not to flee the responsibility).
