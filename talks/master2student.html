# The Full Circle

"In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few"

.b[Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition]<br />
This is per skill, not per person!

Don't be Fixed Mindset,<br />
look for lessons everywhere.

# The Full Circle

Color codes I'll use during the talk:

* .l0[novice]
* .l1[advanced beginner]
* .l2[competent]
* .l3[proficient]
* .l4[expert]

Then back to novice... at other things :)

???
How Dreyfus' skill model applies in some code things.
It's quite close to the Four Stages of competence:
- .l0[unconscious incompetence]
- .l1[conscious incompetence]
- .l23[conscious competence]
- .l4[~ unconscious competence]


Also .l1[Shu].l23[Ha].l4[Ri] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari

# Expectations

Also why I love newbies <3

* .l1[10x: life-changing]
* .l2[2x: life-improving]
* .l3[1.1x (+10%): incremental]
* .l4[10x: life-changing]

... but not via code :)

# Bullshit tolerance

It's so easy to become a grumpy hater :(

* .l1[anything: don't know]
* .l2[non-obvious: confused? Clarify]
* .l3[very little: attitude is key!]
* .l4[anything: better hear small signals]

Anything you hear has some degree of truth for someone.<br />
Accept reality like a Zen buddhist.

# What I want, what I do

Want / Can do & work given

* .l0[Vision / none]
* .l1[Strategy / Ops]
* .l2[Tactics / Tactics]
* .l3[Ops / Strategy]
* .l4[Vision / everything]

.l2[] to .l3[] is hard! You like where you are!<br />
.l3[] to .l4[] is hard! You must change vision!

# Names

Names withheld to protect the culprits

- .l0[] `categories`
- .l1[] `dashboard_categories_counter`
- .l2[] `x`
- .l3[] `counts`
- .l4[] `categories_counts`

... and perhaps back to `dasbhoard_categories_counter` :)

# Names

Advice you can give

- .l0[I just want to stop crashes]
- .l1[explicit names]
- .l2[short names]
- .l3[explicit & as short as possible]
- .l4[self-explanatory names]

not to people of some level, but go through all levels every single time.

# DRY

Don't Repeat Yourself: results

* .l0[I don't get it: Copy-and-Paste]
* .l1[I know I should, and I can't do it]
* .l2[Factors functions, reuses code]
* .l3[Factors structures, reuses classes]
* .l4[Back to Copy-and-Paste?]

Single Source of Truth matters more.

# DRY

Don't Repeat Yourself: focus on

* .l0[Not My Problem]
* .l1[Code]
* .l2[Data]
* .l3[Architecture]
* .l4[Pragmatism]

# Project maturity

Once again about what makes sense

* .l0[tutorial or fear]
* .l1[fills in blanks]
* .l23[rewrites from scratch]
* .l23[painfully adds up to legacy]
* .l4[refactors knowledge]

... and back to address fears (of others) and (writing) tutorials.

# Become a mentor!

You will learn even more!

* .l0[write checklists]
* .l1[code reviews]
* .l2[deliberate practice]
* .l3[architecture katas]
* .l4[train teams, leverage business]

What works will have to scale. Congrats!

# Bonus

How to use StackOverflow

- .l0[read code]
- .l1[make an hypothesis: how it works]
- .l2[why, with what does it work?]
- .l3[check & learn, rinse & repeat]
- .l4[read code: yours, OSS, SO]

And here's the full circle :)

# Thanks!

Now be a proud developer!

- .l0[I can code]
- .l1[my code works]
- .l2[my code is elegant]
- .l3[my code is simple]
- .l4[my code is not the problem]

... but you can leverage code to solve problems, and that's awesome.

# Bonus 2

Priorities

- .l0[make it]

# Bonus 3

Clever code

- .l0[these people hate me]
- .l1[so clever! the dev must be smart]
- .l23[I do clever code & I feel clever]
- .l23[my mess is clean, yours is ugly]
- .l4[this is so needlessly convoluted]

The Master does not think the dev IS stupid.
The Master thinks the dev HAS BEEN less than clever HERE.

# Bonus 4

How to manage your career

- .l0[it will be hard, I will stick with it]
- .l1[team with many tasks & coaching]
- .l2[join a team with mentoring & peers]
- .l3[make sure you keep growing]
- .l4[begin anew]

Most companies can be changed from within.
Change management, theory of orgs, social dynamics...
are very interesting skills to have.
