- .o[The bigger picture:] why, how, longer run
- .y[Getting to the talk:] confs, topics, audiences, CFPs

.o[# The Bigger Picture]

* .r[Why] would you want to talk?
* .g[How] can I become a speaker?
* .b[What] should I plan in the longer run?

---
# Reach more people

* fame, exposure, visibility
* job & travel opportunities
* get out of comfort zone
* commitment to learning
* sharing is caring!

---
class: center
# Personal branding

## .r[Website] + .b[Twitter] + .g[Github]<br />
## contact, content, & trust

Reputation wagers:<br />
usually OK, except exceptions

---
class: center middle wide
.y[# Getting to the talk]

* What is a good .r[topic?]
* For which .g[audience?]
* .b[Where] to talk?
* How do .w[CFPs] work?

---
# Kinds of conferences

* BBLs: lunch
* meetups: pizzas & drinks?
* local: location, catering, parties?
* international: speaker "fees"?

---
# The Conference Ciruit

Conferences cost money. <br />
Some make money, others offset costs.

More money means more exposure, famous keynoters, venues,
catering, video, accessibility, childcare...

Swag is not money.

---
# Money hacks confs

Companies pay for sponsoring, attendance (cheaper than salary),
and of course can sponsor speakers.

**Imbalance:** representation, practice, "fame"

A good topic/speaker for a conf, is one that sells.

---
# CFPs

Until you're called/chosen, find CFPs by @CallbackWomen

* send bio, abstract, information
* good choice: commitee, blind review
* no choice: free sposts, cancellations
* contact the organisers: twitter/mail
* some offer speaker coaching!

---
class: center middle wide
.g[# Preparation]

* .r[The idea]
* The .o[abstract] + .y[bio]
* .g[Slide design] (if any!)
* .b[Rehearsal] (if any?)

# Idea

What do you know now that:
* you didn't know a year before?
* would have helped then?

That's a great talk idea.<br />
You're the expert on yourself!

Disclaimer: I do pun/title-driven talks

---
# Abstract & bio

With audience and topic in hand,<br />you can't really go wrong.

Copywriting is a job (not mine).<br />Barring that, cross-reads.

Get a (several?) bio(s) ready

---
# Slide design & rehearsal

.r[Content], .g[Legibility], .b[Attractiveness]<br />
Text -> Titles -> Pictures

.r[Audience]? .g[Interests]? .b[Inclusivity]?<br />
This is the age of the smartphone!

Disclaimer: I am mostly unprepared

---
# Tools for slides

Keynote & PPTX: form is not function!
Remote control: a good idea if you move

Anything HTML/JS, like reveal.js (beware: Node.js server)

Disclaimer: this is remark.js

---
# ... no slides?

- improv
- slide karaoke
- songs, theater play, drawings...

Live-code is impressive, but DANGER!
Have backup plans like git branches.
Use a gem for magic typing like Computering.

.b[# Giving a talk]

* .r[Before:] be OK, show up, set up
* .o[On stage:] greet, speak, move, thank
* .y[Speaking:] rythm, pauses, eye contact
* .g[Questions] if any, hecklers if any
* .b[Off stage:] people know you now!

---
# Before the talk

* Travel, eat, drink, sleep
* Connect with people, city, rehearse

* If you have anything technical it can break, prepare for it
* Mics can be weird (touching)

---
# On stage

* introduction: not too long
* no sales pitch, can be done later
* mention questions quickly

* be yourself (AND polite, if you need reminders)
* look at a few select people at a time

---
# Problems

* if you screw up, back up
* hecklers: address or ignore
* if tech breaks... you DO have a plan B?

---
# Off-stage

* you are now famous!
* people know you, but you don't

People come to you and you have a topic in common.
Great if you need conversation openers to not be awkward,
may need a little practice to get hecklers/harassers out.

It's awesome to open conferences rather than speaking at the end ^^

.t[# Actually going]

* .r[Be safe, feel safe]

* .g[Move, sleep, relax...]
