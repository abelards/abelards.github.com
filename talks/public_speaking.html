# Public speaking

An event by [Ladies of Code Paris](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Ladies-of-Code-Paris/events/236007287/)<br />
Masterclass & workshop by [@cczona](https://twitter.com/cczona)<br />

.info[This was meant to be a backup talk by [@abelar_s](https://twitter.com/abelar_s)<br />
It's been hugely expanded by her points,<br />not sure if all points still makes sense]

.w[# Public speaking]

- .o[The bigger picture:] why, how, longer run
- .y[Getting to the talk:] confs, topics, audiences, CFPs
- .g[Preparation:] idea, abstract, design, rehearsal
- .b[Giving a talk:] before, on/off stage, questions
- .t[Actually going:] safety, bag, planning

---
class: center middle wide
.o[# The Bigger Picture]

* .r[Why] would I want to talk?
* .g[How] can I become a speaker?
* .b[What] should I plan in the longer run?

---
# Reach more people

* "fame": exposure, visibility
* job & travel opportunities
* get out of comfort zone
* commitment to learning
* sharing is caring!

---
class: center
# Personal branding

## .r[Website] + .b[Twitter] + .g[Github]<br />
## contact, content, & trust

Reputation wagers:<br />
usually OK, except exceptions

---
class: center middle wide
.y[# Getting to the talk]

1. What is a good .r[topic?]
2. For which .g[audience?]
3. .b[Where] to talk?
4. How do .w[CFPs] work?

=> 1. where, 2. who, 3. what, 4. how

---
# Kinds of conferences

* .g[BBLs:] lunch
* .b[meetups:] pizzas & drinks?
* .r[local:] location, catering, parties?
* .o[international:] speaker "fees"?

---
# Choosing a conference
## community? company?

* number of tracks, people
* ticket price, fanciness of swag
* reputation (content or parties?)
* venue (classrooms or amphitheaters)
* safety: CoC + afterparties + alcohol?

---
# Accessibility

* disabilities, moving
* translations, subtitles
* child care
* Code of Conduct
* CoC pledge + JamaisSansElles

---
# Kinds of talks

.g[Talks], .b[lightning talks], .r[workshops]

But also improv, slide karaoke, songs, theater play, drawings...

.o[Live-coding] is impressive, but DANGER!

.info[Use a huge font.<br />
Have backup plans like git branches.<br />
Use a gem for magic typing like Computering.]

---
# The Conference Ciruit

Conferences cost money. <br />
Some make money, others offset costs.

More money means more exposure, famous keynoters, venues,
catering, video, accessibility, childcare...

.info[Swag is not money.]

---
# Money hacks confs

Companies pay for sponsoring, attendance (cheaper than salary),<br />
and of course can sponsor speakers.

**Imbalance:** visibility, practice, "fame"

A good topic/speaker for a conf, is one that sells.

---
# CFPs: you answer

Confs put out Calls for Papers (CFPs)<br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/CallbackWomen">@CallbackWomen</a> curates CFPs

* send bio, abstract, information
* you can often submit several talks!

---
# CFP tricks

## Contact the organisers!

* most submissions are sent in the last 12 hours: the earlier you submit, the better feedback you get!

* some offer speaker coaching

* some will stream/put up the videos, are you OK?

---
# CFPs: they choose

How will talks be chosen?<br />
Usually they explain how:<br />
program commitee, tracks and such.

More and more confs reach out to every kind of speaker by doing blind review (anonymized abstracts).

.info[Sometimes, a speaker cancels at short notice and confs fill slots on the spot.<br />
If you have slides ready you can step up!]

---
# Selecting opportunities

* .y[personal] agenda (cities, friends)
* .g[professional] benefit, visibility
* .b[speaker support] / affordability
* .r[accessibility], diversity/inclusion
* recommendation, reputation, .o[safety]

---
# Tokenism
## I'm chosen because I'm a [X]

* .g[OK!] I will give a great talk
* .g[OK!] I will increase role models
* .b[???] I'm [X] talking only about [X]
* .o[NO!] You are just [X]-washing
* .o[NO!] You won't respect my being [X]

Ask if necessary: their attitude will show

---
class: center middle wide
.g[# Preparation]

* .r[The idea]
* The .o[abstract] + .y[bio]
* .g[Slide design] (if any!)
* .b[Rehearsal] (if any?)

# Idea generation

Some guidelines can be provided by the conference, its tracks, in the CFP...

<a href="https://twitter.com/sandimetz">@SandiMetz</a>'s trick:<br />
what do you know now that you didn't know a year before and would have helped then?

<a href="https://twitter.com/sarahmei">@sarahmei</a>'s trick:<br />
something you don't know but want to learn -- you'll have an excuse to study!

???

If there's anything you feel compelled to talk about,
that people usually get wrong, that's trendy or provocative,
or you got an idea by a metaphor, a pun, a title you wanted...
you can still use these tricks to refine the talk ideas!

---
# Baits

* .y[Trendy]/.r[controversy] is good bait
* Try to aim for .g[shelf-life] (long-term)
* .o[Do not give sales pitches!]<br />.info[Techies often resent if you have a stake]

.info['Soft talks' are super important but know they have a price, as they are often less respected]

.info[If the topic is overdone, your opinion on it is valuable/shareable anyway!
Try to guess what's the competition though: too many of the same topics, or better qualified (X creator / company Y)]

---
# Abstract

.r[Title:] evocative, short. If joke, make sure it'll be understood

.o[Description:] a sales pitch for the conf AND the audience

.y[More:] you can split problem / solution or pitch / detail

.g[Takeaway:] also a great idea to write the talk. If audience walk home with ONE valuable thing, what would it be?


---
# Abstract & bio

With audience and topic in hand,<br />you can't really go wrong.

Copywriting is a job (not mine).<br />Barring that, cross-reads.

Get a bio ready in the third person.<br />Adapt to conf if possible.

.info[Research and writing is hard, some don't want to work in advance (before being accepted).<br />
But time can be short, it's cool to have talks ready beforehand.]

---
# Slide design & rehearsal

.r[Content], .g[Legibility], .b[Attractiveness]<br />
Text -> Titles -> Pictures

.r[Audience]? .g[Interests]? .b[Inclusivity]?<br />
This is the age of the smartphone!

Disclaimer: I am mostly unprepared

---
# Twittable content
## Works for other social media

* put your Twitter upfront
* shock points in 140 characters
* photo-friendly slides
* pin "invite me talk about X!" tweet

Storify the good tweets afterward?

---
# Slide design

## .b[Contrast]
## .g[Huge font]
## .y[Top of screen]

.info[whatever is down or too small or not enough contrast or phrased weirdly and convoluted grammar will be a pain for your public that's desperately trying to follow, and it can even distract them from listening to you as they struggle to find out]

---
# Tools for slides

* .o[Backups:] spare USB key with content
* .b[Clicker/Remote:] allow moving

* .g[Keynote & PPTX:] form is not function!
* Anything HTML/JS (Markdown!)

.info[This is <a href="http://remarkjs.com/">remark.js</a> -
<a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/1">reveal.js</a> needs a server?<br />
Look for presenter mode and export formats]

---
# Speaker bag

* clicker/remote + batteries
* adapters (esp. Macs)
* snacks (water, sugar)
* tissues, hygiene, personal stuff
* anything relieving stage fright

Marked with your email!

---
# Ask conferences

* tools at hand (blackboards, wifi?)
* aspect ratio, adapters, lighting?
* slide templates

Ask again:
* size, tracks, audience
* hotel, travel, refunds...
* when to communicate ("embargo")

---
class: center middle wide
.b[# Giving a talk]

* .r[Before:] be OK, show up, set up
* .o[On stage:] greet, speak, move, thank
* .y[Speaking:] rythm, pauses, eye contact
* .g[Questions] if any, hecklers if any
* .b[Off stage:] people know you now!

---
# Before the talk

* .g[Travel, eat, drink, sleep]
* .b[Connect with people, city]
* .w[Rehearse, for stage fright & timing]

* If you have anything technical<br />.o[it can break], prepare for it
* Mics can be weird (touching)

---
# Stage fright

.o[Everybody has it! Don't hold back!]

* Know how it affects your .y[body]
* Know how to calm your .r[mind]
* You will probably speak .b[much faster]
* Add this to your own list

.g[The audience wants you to succeed!]

.info[Anything to help, like dressing differently, breathing, meditating, visualising, and so]

---
# On stage: introduction

* .g[introduction]: hello, thanks, name
* establishes expertise, no sales pitch though
* not your life story unless it's the point

* mention questions quickly
* perhaps a plan?

---
# On stage: delivery

* be yourself .info[(& polite, if you need reminders)]
* look at a few select people at a time
* have rythm and pauses

SLOW DOWN (you go faster, right?)

* .b[questions:] repeat questions in the mic<br />.info[also rephrasing helps making sure you understood]
* get a .g[clear finish] (thanks & applause)

---
# Technical problems
## Laugh them off!

* if you screw up, back up

* if tech breaks, have a plan B
* people/organisers will back you up

.info[Go to events to see others screw up and get back up<br />
Admit vulnerability (if you feel OK with this)]

---
# People problems

* hecklers: address or ignore
* address touchy questions beforehand
* people leaving: likely true need<br />.info[don't be upset - bladder/boss/partner calling]<br />.info[Some confs have a table at the back for people on call]

---
# Non-question question

Someone 

- trying to get a stage he didn't earn
- you did the work, not them
- most people know what he's doing
- "we can talk about it later"
- "yes, but out of scope for this talk"
- "yes we saw you" ^^

---
# Jerks

- stop, sshh, appeasing arms gesture
- it's OK to ask for laptops/phone out
- it's OK to call out disruptors
- speakers got applaused for this! 
- touching etiquette

.info[it's OK to focus on the "emphatic nodder"<br />
if you are afraid of eye contact, stare the shoulder, they can't tell]

---
# Off-stage

* you are now famous!
* people know you, but you don't
* people come to you
* you have a topic in common

.info[Great conversation openers, less awkwardness,<br />
little practice to get hecklers/harassers out.

It's awesome to open conferences rather than speaking at the end ^^]

---

.t[# Actually going]

* .r[Be safe, feel safe]
* .o[Travel to places]
* .y[Pack your bags, check your tech]
* .g[Move, sleep, relax...]
* .b[Tweet?]
