- .o[The bigger picture:] why, how, longer run

.o[# The Bigger Picture]

* .r[Why] would I want to talk?
* .g[How] can I become a speaker?
* .b[What] should I plan in the longer run?

---
# Reach more people

* "fame": exposure, visibility
* job & travel opportunities
* get out of comfort zone
* commitment to learning
* sharing is caring!

---
class: center
# Personal branding

## .r[Website] + .b[Twitter] + .g[Github]<br />
## contact, content, & trust

Reputation wagers:<br />
usually OK, except exceptions

---
class: center middle wide
.y[# Getting to the talk]

1. What is a good .r[topic?]
2. For which .g[audience?]
3. .b[Where] to talk?
4. How do .w[CFPs] work?

=> 1. where, 2. who, 3. what, 4. how

# Kinds of conferences

* .g[BBLs:] lunch
* .b[meetups:] pizzas & drinks?
* .r[local:] location, catering, parties?
* .o[international:] speaker "fees"?

---
# Choosing a conference
## community? company?

* number of tracks, people
* ticket price, fanciness of swag
* reputation (content or parties?)
* venue (classrooms or amphitheaters)
* safety: CoC + afterparties + alcohol?

---
# Accessibility

* disabilities, moving
* translations, subtitles
* child care
* Code of Conduct
* CoC pledge + JamaisSansElles

---
# Kinds of talks

* talks, lightning talks, workshops

* without slides:
  - improv, slide karaoke
  - songs, theater play, drawings...

Live-code is impressive, but DANGER!<br />
.info[Have backup plans like git branches.<br />
Use a gem for magic typing like Computering.]

---
# The Conference Ciruit

Conferences cost money. <br />
Some make money, others offset costs.

More money means more exposure, famous keynoters, venues,
catering, video, accessibility, childcare...

.info[Swag is not money.]

---
# Money hacks confs

Companies pay for sponsoring, attendance (cheaper than salary),<br />
and of course can sponsor speakers.

**Imbalance:** visibility, practice, "fame"

A good topic/speaker for a conf, is one that sells.

---
# CFPs

Until you're called/chosen,<br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/CallbackWomen">@CallbackWomen</a> curates CFPs

* send bio, abstract, information
* choice: commitee, blind review
* no choice: free sposts, cancellations
* contact the organisers: twitter/mail
* some offer speaker coaching

---
# Selecting opportunities

* personal agenda (cities, friends)
* professional benefit, visibility
* speaker support / affordability
* accessibility, diversity/inclusion
* recommendation, reputation, safety

---
# Tokenism
## I'm chosen because I'm a...

* OK! I will give a great talk
* OK! I will increase role models
* ~ I'm [X] talking only about [X]
* NO! You are just [X]-washing
* NO! You won't respect my being [X]

Ask if necessary

# Idea

<a href="https://twitter.com/sandimetz">@SandiMetz</a>'s trick:<br />
what do you know now that you didn't know a year before and would have helped then?

<a href="https://twitter.com/sarahmei">@sarahmei</a>'s trick:<br />
something you don't know but want to learn -- you'll have an excuse to study!

.info[If there's anything you feel compelled to talk about,
that people usually get wrong, that's trendy or provocative,
or you got an idea by a metaphor, a pun, a title you wanted...
you can still use these tricks to refine the talk ideas!]

---
# Baits

* trendy/controversy is good bait
* try to aim for shelf-life?

* 101: not if creator/company are there
* your opinion is valuable/shareable

.info['soft talks' are super important but know they have a price, as they are often less respected]

---
# Abstract & bio

With audience and topic in hand,<br />you can't really go wrong.

Copywriting is a job (not mine).<br />Barring that, cross-reads.

Get a bio ready. Adapt if needed.

Time can be short, you can have talks ready beforehand if you need preparation.

---
# Slide design & rehearsal

.r[Content], .g[Legibility], .b[Attractiveness]<br />
Text -> Titles -> Pictures

.r[Audience]? .g[Interests]? .b[Inclusivity]?<br />
This is the age of the smartphone!

Disclaimer: I am mostly unprepared

---
# Twittable content
## Works for other social media

* put your Twitter upfront
* shock points in 140 characters
* photo-friendly slides
* pin "invite me talk about X!" tweet

Storify the good tweets afterward?

---
# Slide design

## Contrast
## Huge font
## Top of screen

.info[whatever is down or too small or not enough contrast or phrased weirdly and convoluted grammar will be a pain for your public that's desperately trying to follow, and it can even distract them from listening to you as they struggle to find out]

---
# Tools for slides

* .o[Backups:] spare USB key with content
* .b[Clicker/Remote:] allow moving

* .g[Keynote & PPTX:] form is not function!
* Anything HTML/JS (Markdown!)

.info[This is <a href="http://remarkjs.com/">remark.js</a> -
<a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/1">reveal.js</a> needs a server?<br />
Look for presenter mode and export formats]

---
# Speaker bag

* clicker/remote + batteries
* adapters (esp. Macs)
* snacks (water, sugar)
* tissues, hygiene, personal stuff
* anything relieving stage fright

Marked with your email!

---
# Ask conferences

* tools at hand (blackboards, wifi?)
* aspect ratio, adapters, lighting?
* slide templates

Ask again:
* size, tracks, audience
* hotel, travel, refunds...
* when to communicate ("embargo")

---
class: center middle wide
.b[# Giving a talk]

* .r[Before:] be OK, show up, set up
* .o[On stage:] greet, speak, move, thank
* .y[Speaking:] rythm, pauses, eye contact
* .g[Questions] if any, hecklers if any
* .b[Off stage:] people know you now!

---
# Before the talk

* Travel, eat, drink, sleep
* Connect with people, city
* Rehearse, for stage fright & timing

* If you have anything technical<br /> it can break, prepare for it
* Mics can be weird (touching)

---
# Stage fright

* Everybody has it! Don't hold back!
* Know how it affects your body
* Know how to calm your mind
* Add this to your own list

The audience wants you to succeed!

.info[Anything to help, like dressing, visualising, and so]

---
# On stage

* introduction: not too long
* no sales pitch, can be done later
* mention questions quickly

* be yourself .info[(& polite, if you need reminders)]
* look at a few select people at a time

---
# Technical problems
## Laugh it off!

* if you screw up, back up

* if tech breaks, have a plan B
* people/organisers will back you up

.info[Go to events to see others screw up and get back up<br />
Admit vulnerability if you feel OK with this.]

---
# People problems

* hecklers: address or ignore
* address touchy questions beforehand
* questions-that-are-not-questions
* people leaving: likely true need<br />.info[don't be upset - bladder/boss/partner calling]

.info[it's OK to focus on the "emphatic nodder"<br />
if you are afraid of eye contact, stare the shoulder, they can't tell]

---
# Non-question question

- trying to get a stage he didn't earn
- you did the work, not them
- most people know what he's doing
- "we can talk about it later"
- "yes we saw you" ^^

---
# Jerks

- stop, sshh, appeasing arms gesture
- it's OK to ask for laptops/phone out
- it's OK to call out disruptors
- speakers got applaused for this! 
- touching etiquette

Some confs have at table at the back for people on call

---
# Off-stage

* you are now famous!
* people know you, but you don't
* people come to you
* you have a topic in common

.info[Great conversation openers, less awkwardness,<br />
little practice to get hecklers/harassers out.

It's awesome to open conferences rather than speaking at the end ^^]
