# 10 years

* my phone was a Nokia 3310
* smartphones & data weren't there

* no GitHub, no StackOverflow!
* doc was: man, MLs, forums, blogs

* crises, wars, demagogy, collusion
* plenty of progress since (science, medicine)

???

I hated phone calls, I still do, but hey, they have games & internet now!

10 years ago was a very different place.
The values are the same but the context slightly changed.

This is a talk of hope, not a rant.

# Security IS health & care

For you: infosec + process + metrics

For others: info leak + impersonation

For some people, self-reinforcing feedback, privacy are key.
A SLIGHT PROBLEM here can mean DEATH.
