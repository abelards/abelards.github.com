# Complaining

- is it a problem?
- does complaining help?


---
class: left
# Is it a problem?

- is it still a problem?
- whose problem is this?
- did you voice your concerns?

- does complaining help?
- make you look good/bad?
- is it actionable?

---
class: left
# Whose problem is this?

- yours?
- no-one's?

Someone else's?

---
class: left
# Someone else's

- someone else that
- really exists?
- will not answer?
- is not concerned?
- suffers less than you?
- has proven they will not respond?

Doesn't understand the cost. Yet.

---
class: left
# Did you voice concerns?

- to the right person?
- on the right terms?
- just to make you look good?
- just to make them look bad?
- just to make it someone else's problem?

So... does complaining help?

---
class: left
# Did you say

- a rant?
- insults?
- helpless stuff?

- important?
- interesting?
- actionable things?

---
class: left
# Is it still a problem?

- does it need fixing?
- cost of fixing
- cost of not fixing
- priorities

---
class: left
# How will you fix it?

- workarounds
- documentation
- the start of a fix
- the start of a team

---
class: left
# How did you fix it?

- by creating bigger problems
- by moving the problem elsewhere
- by not thinking about it anymore

- did you fix another, unrelated problem?
- did you spend twice the energy fixing half a problem?

---
class: left
# After the fix

- did you tell the right people?
- were you interesting? actionable?
- making people look good or bad?
- will a similar problem arise?
- when? how to fix? will they know?
