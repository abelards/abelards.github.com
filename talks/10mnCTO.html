Hi everyone,
I often get asked if I can be or refer to a CTO.
Coders also ask me how to become one, which would be another talk entirely (but this could do as an introduction).

This is mostly yet another talk of mine for devs to understand managers and vice-versa,
because work throws us at each other and we have to communicate to get anywhere.

# What is a CTO?
## Chinese Master?
### Young Gullible With Shiny Title?

???
As always, we first need to define what the topic at hand is.
Either you need an old guru, chinese-master like, and I bow to you,
or you need a single, young, gullible developer and the CTO title is a way to pay less.

# What is a 10mn CTO?

## 10mn of bullet points

### emulate being/having a CTO

???
Something you could use to quickly get, understand or emulate what a CTO does.

This talk is a shorter <a href="/talks/2e_tech_lead.html">2€ CTO</a>.
If you want to follow through I suggest you go read that one.

In there I give more hints and things to read about.
It looks like it costs nothing, but time is definitely NOT free.

# Tech Adoption
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/45/DiffusionOfInnovation.png" />
<h3 class="gold"> Works for products, hires, leaves</h3>

???
Here is the Technology Adoption Lifecycle.
If you sell a product, you will talk to these kind of people, one after another.

Interestingly enough, this will also work for your hires:
your cofounders are likely innovators (novelty attracts them),
your 1st hires are likely early adopters (novelty doesn't frighten them).

So be prepared: you will hire early/late majority:
either by opportunity (innovators are few) or attrition (innovators flee).

# Hype Cycle
<div style="background: #CCC;padding:1em;">
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Gartner_Hype_Cycle.svg" />
</div>

???
Here is the Hype Cycle.
A combination of many psychological and economic things, I won't dwell on that too much.

Just remember this applies to technologies. How do articles sound now?
Rails is Dead! NodeJS is all the rage!
(of course, you might just have a useless toy without a plateau of productivity)

Remember this also happens to people, and most likely to your company:
You barely even launched, you got media coverage? Great, remember it's inflated.
You have a product that works, invested in scaling, and nobody buys? Disillusionment.

Keep in mind that might drive your innovators away. How will you live through this?

# History shapes code
## <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000059.html">Code/UI reflects history</a>

- That big customer's requirements
- Devices and leaky abstractions
- Support

???
We all lack time.
So whenever there's a quick win, quick fix, an emergency...
things get added without conscious, thought-out plan.

You will find your ocdebase (and your UI!) littered with these choices.
This is Technical Debt.

# Org shapes code

- Teams, splits, responsibilities
- Deadline-induced rushes
- Who talks to whom
- Each intern

<h2 class="gold"> changing (org <=> code)</h2>

???
It is said code reflects the organisation that made it happen.

If you change the organisation, you probably expect delays,
uncertainty, overlap and holes in many jobs. In code too.

???
What we need is explained in The Pragmatic / Passionate Programmer.
Just read this, I don't have time to redo the stories and it's a shame to cut them.

**Monkey trap:** when you won't let go and you should
**Boiling frog:** when you want sudden changes and you should do it slowly
**Stone soup:** how to get buy-ins from a hostile crowd

If that was abstract, here are a few concrete examples, and links to other talks.
Understand things that look simple are often not, and put safeguards against human error.
Think of it as stupid users if you will, but it will often save you from yourself.

# Your stack
<span class="gold">What do you know, how do you know it?</span>

Factoids! Trends! FOMO! FUD!

<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culte_du_cargo#Le_culte_du_cargo.2C_m.C3.A9taphore_et_th.C3.A8me">
<img src="//lh6.googleusercontent.com/m0JcOzjp2pgY9opaN9xbtAI4VE9rFJr1gSnImxbW4QWIlqBJj5vIXwSKER5gHnF6EDwGX9F2C-CpYdltC90KslCaTPIOJGaigVn-iPBn1Namzhly-6vE-ALHnUM9ws42xg" />
</a>

???
For any technical choice, I will of course recommend either my company or Ruby/Rails.
With the years I've become more forgiving (some say less arrogant?),
and understand you probably chose your stack based on shiny blogs,
advice from people with vested interests, and rationalising choices.

I will talk about trends, SocialFX dealt with factoids.
Looking at trends is a nice indicator, but beware
- Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO -- what if I skipped the killer tech?)
- FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt -- these people win money if everyone believes their lies)

One of the biggest and probably unwitting examples is devs patting
themselves on the back when they've done a rewrite in another tech.
OK, they should, because they made their boss part with a big chunk of money
for them to play with new techs: being grateful is the least they can do :)

But the trick is: they already know the project and problems well,
and given a rewrite cost they probably have buy-in from the bosses.
But could they have got the same pleasure and gains just with time off
for a rewrite, from techn X to... tech X? It is often so.

---
class: center
# Your code
## "We need to rewrite" <br /> <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">probably wrong</a>
- Why is this person telling you this?
- You got it wrong once, why not twice?
- You got it right once, why not expand?

???

We all pretend to be smartasses because we know what's right and
everything is obvious both in context and in hindsight.

Just remember the person might have a hidden interest:
money is obvious, trying to have the office closest to the window / coffee isn't.

If you're a late majority I probably should tell you risks are worth it,
and you sometimes need to change.
But this is a Ruby meetup, so instead I probably have to tell you to slow down
and weigh options. If not for the project, at least to get some respect.

Nothing is all black or all white, you can probably please both sides
of the table by just isolating what is or isn't worth it. And you'll
know both your codebase and the problem space better.

# Your goals
## Are you choosing
- <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000024.html">McD vs gourmet food?</a>
- Someone just like you?
- To be a boss or leader?
- Lang skills or problem-solving?
- To solve scalability that won't happen?

???
So if we're turning the "choosing the right tech" into a
"choosing the right person (with some tech knowledge)" debate,
we should probably inquire about how we choose people.

And how we choose problems too.

---
class: center
# Your TODO
## Are you choosing people to

- make it
- test it
- change it
- deploy it
- run it
- fix it

???
Here's the sanity check: would you trust someone to make but not test?
To run but not fix? If not, that is a huge no-go.

I actually don't think there are so many people with such a problem.
But I do think some have problems with these, and you can help with the right environment.

# Team
## It's hard to hire seniors

- Understand what they need
- Mentors, someone to look up to
- Non-dev tech people (<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2010/01/26.html">testers?</a>)
- Designers, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000057.html">UX people</a>
- Other non-tech (politics *shielders*)
- Train juniors

???
Here are super ideas if you can't hire seniors devs:
- hire people who aren't devs
- give non-seniors the ability to deliver like seniors

And it's easier than you think. You just have to shed some prejudices.

---
class: center, ruby
# Team
## What they need

- Politics-free
- Offices, quiet
- Books, tools

???
Free the devs from politics, from noise and interruptions,
give them tools and (the right amount of) freedom.

This costs WAY LESS than hiring more people, by the way.

# Individuals
## 10x developer

- 10x the bullshit
- 10x manager?

???
Top speed?

The fact that there can be 10x developers is probably an ego-flattering scam.
Even if it works, it probably means there is poor person/task fit.

This is not fixed by hiring 10x devs (would you pay the 10x salary they deserve?)
but in recruiting and managing people.

Also, if there is a tiny truth behind 10x devs, it's so harmful to people
(beginners and introverts particularly) that it's not worth seeking anyway.

You might hire a costly rockstar by promising a 10x-devs-team.
You would have an even better ROI by having a compassionate tech lead
who would raise the bar and triple the productivity for each of your 5 juniors.

---
class: center, ruby
# Individuals
## So who should I hire?

- Pirate ninja rockstar fireman?
- or... Code gardener!

<a href="http://sijinjoseph.com/programmer-competency-matrix/">
Programmer Competency Matrix</a>

???
It's a nice refresher for your personal growth, less biased interviews, or forwarding to friends.
A few companies doing open-salary policies (FogCreek, Buffer) provide some matrices of their own.

# T-shaped individuals

Would you recruit Renaissance developers?

<h1 class="gold"> Dreyfus Team</h1>
## Experts write tools for others to use
- Dreyfus' model of skill
- acquisition (bonus slide #1)
- Enhances productivity
- Reduces damage
- Get to Flow

???
If I've shown you something it's how you can't and shouldn't have an
all-experts team, be it for long-term purposes, accident-proofing your
team, or simply to maximise revenue.

In a mixed-skill environment, or to onboard people safely,
you probably want to have some code, or code-writing process,
which also is Baka-Yoke ("stupid-proof").

This will let beginners learn recipes to become proficient,
let skilled room to experiment and confront their model,
and harness the maximum out of the masters.

<div style="background: #CCC;padding:1em;">
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Challenge_vs_skill.svg" />
</div>
???

You have all kind of problems, and some are easy:
take that opportunity to teach the juniors, and not bore the masters!
By keeping people in the right amount of challenge / skill,
you're creating the infinitely precious Flow.
