    <p>The young abbots <a href="http://thecodelesscode.com/names/Aki">Aki</a> and <a href="http://thecodelesscode.com/names/Haru">Haru</a> had known each other for
a few years as novice monks, and were eager to prove their
methods were better than their rival’s.</p>

<p>The old monk <a href="http://thecodelesscode.com/names/Shinpuru">Shinpuru</a> was working on many projects and found
himself working under the order of both junior abbots.</p>

<p>Master <a href="http://thecodelesscode.com/names/Zjing">Zjing</a> heard of this and came by to form an opinion.</p>

<p class="c">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p>“Good evening, monk,” she said.
“I’ve never seen you in these gardens before.
Would you tell me a word on our newest abbots?”</p>

<p>“Good evening, master,” Shinpuru replied bowing politely.
“Both abbots have very little in common but their eagerness
and motivation. For this I am grateful, and thanks to their
example I found the motivation to start cultivating these
two additional plots recently.</p>

<p>“This first plot I set out after Haru’s example.
After much work of planning, leveling, ploughing, weeding,
I’ve endured criticism for there was no plant to please
the monks’ eyes. Now I planted grass on it:
it’s perfectly cut and requires minimal maintenance.
Nothing will ever get out of control, which is for once relaxing.”</p>

<p>Commented Zjing: “It is indeed a picture of quiet and order,
and I will enjoy sitting on fresh grass this spring for my
morning meditations.
It is a shame you had to endure criticism while working.”</p>

<p class="c">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p>“This second plot,” added Shinpuru leading her to the opposite
of the courtyard, “is more fitting with Aki’s nature.
As soon as I got my hands on it, I added big, colourful flower
bushes, and have kept changing ever since.
Some of the flowers die, but others prosper and grow,
even though I kept adding even more plants.
Growing in that competitive environment, the offspring are strong
and I’m eager to see what this garden can teach me.”</p>

<p>Commented Zjing: “It does look a bit messy but 
these bright colours mixes most certainly please my eyes.
Everywhere I look I can see delighting details in your work.
But would you leave this unattended, don’t you fear weed would
upset the delicate balance and overtake your garden?”</p>

<p class="c">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p>Shinpuru thanked Zjing, bowed, and left.</p>

<p>She was still standing before the second garden,
wondering what correction or praise the two young abbots deserved.</p>
