    <p>Two recently appointed abbots <a href="#{NAME}/Aki">Aki</a> and <a href="#{NAME}/Haru">Haru</a>
were assigned to their teams and projects.
Due to the recurring shortage of abbots at the Temple<a href="#note-*" id="noteref-*"><sup class="footnote">*</sup></a>,
they were given much freedom in choosing their ways of leading
despite their young age.</p>

<p>They were also led by a healthy dose of righteousness,
foolishness, and most of all the wish of not losing one’s head.</p>

<p>Upon arriving to the <a href="#{NAME}/Spider Clan">Spider Clan</a>, <a href="#{NAME}/Aki">Aki</a> immediately
launched several projects at once, redirecting the monks from
previous tasks. “The Emperor is waiting for us”, he said,
“and he is not famous for his patience.”</p>

<p>Surely, this would please the Province Governor.</p>

<p>But <a href="#{NAME}/Haru">Haru</a> scoffed at this attitude: he immediately
set up the guidelines, the meetings and documents that
should be produced before working, like <a href="#{CASE}/154">True Engineers</a> should.
“Once we deliver applications to the Emperor, their failure
is ours. No surprises to him, nobody among us surprisingly
losing his head.”</p>

<p>Surely, this would please the Temple’s masters,
and upon her return master <a href="#{NAME}/Suku">Suku</a> would find a cleaner abbey.</p>

<p class="c">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p>Thanks to his knowledge on the ways of the Temple,
the old monk <a href="#{NAME}/Shinpuru">Shinpuru</a> was asked to help on many projects,
and he soon found himself having to answer orders from two
heads at the same time.</p>

<p>As gardening was soothing his mind, he asked master <a href="#{NAME}/Banzen">Banzen</a>
for the permission of creating two shrubs.
The master mercifully agreed.</p>

<p class="c">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p>The first garden did not show any sign of improvement for weeks.</p>

<p>Aki had difficult deadlines to meet, and required full
attention from his monks. He came find the senior monk one evening.</p>

<p>Shinpuru was sitting before it, silently contemplating.</p>

<p>“You asked for two plots, yet you let this one untouched”, noted the abbot.
“What purpose are you seeking?”</p>

<p>“Planning,” said Shinpuru.</p>

<p class="c">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p>The second garden was quickly sowed with a mix of whatever
Shinpuru could find. Many kind of flowers were blossoming,
but one could recognize weeds that would steal the other
flowers’ nutrients.</p>

<p>Haru had a big overhaul to do, and required full attention
from his monks. He came find the senior monk one evening.</p>

<p>Shinpuru was removing some of the plants in no particular order.</p>

<p>“You are pulling today the flowers you sowed last week,” noted the abbot.
“What purpose are you seeking?”</p>

<p>“I changed my priorities, and like this colour better”, said Shinpuru.</p>

<p class="c">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p>Both abbots returned to their quarters with stronger faith in their own ways.</p>

<h3>Qi's poem</h3>

<p>Tell two people the same thing <br />
they can hear two things <br />
depending on previous faith.</p>

    <a href="#noteref-*"><sup class="footnote">*</sup></a>&nbsp; As documented in cases <a href="#{CASE}61">61</a>, <a href="#{CASE}62">62</a>, <a href="#{CASE}67">67</a>, <a href="#{CASE}104">104</a>, <a href="#{CASE}120">120</a>, <a href="#{CASE}179">179</a> and probably a few others besides. Abbots in the Spider Clan have the average life expectancy of a rice bowl before a starving novice.
